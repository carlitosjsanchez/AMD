OK TIME TO FIX THIS.

IGNORING THE OUT-OF-THE-ORDINARY RESULTS:
    
AVG COST IS $35.411 PER METRIC TON

AVG MILES IS 6.4021 MILES

SO IN BRASIL THE AVERAGE ....

FORMULA WAS:
    
TC == [PF x {(CAP)^-1}] * 2D

TC = TRANSPORTATION COST [COST PER MILE-TON]

PF = FACTOR INDICATING THE AVERAGE MARKET FREIGHT PRICE ($US/TON)

CAP = CAPACITY OF THE TRUCK WAS MEASURED IN TONS (T)

2 = DISTANCE MULTIPLIED BY 2, AS IT CONSIDERS THE ROUND TRIP;

D = DISTANCE (KM) ... BUT ALSO CONVERT TO KILOMETERS.

'''

avg_cost = 35.411
avg_miles = 6.4021

avg_cost_per_ton_mile = avg_miles / avg_cost

'''
SO THE AVERAGE COST PER TON-MILE IS ABOUT $0.18 USD

BUT NOW, WE NEED A FORMULA.

TO FINISH THE JOB. I FOUND IT ALREADY.

LOOK FOR IT.

OK, LET'S USE SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH. [SLC, UTAH]

TC == [PF x {(CAP)^-1}] * 2D

TC == [1 x (13)^-1] * 10

1 = $1USD/ METRIC TON
13 = METRIC TONS IT CAN CARRY
10 = 2*5 MILES ONE-WAY, 2X FOR ROUND-TRIP.

TC == $0.7692 [COST PER MILE TON]


- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOW, LET'S DO THE AVERAGE COST WITH THE VALUE I USED.

TC == [PF x {(CAP)^-1}] * 2D

TC == [0.18 x (13)^-1] * 10

0.18 = $0.18 AVERAGE COST PER MILE.
13 = METRIC TONS IT CAN CARRY
10 = 2*5 MILES ONE-WAY, 2X FOR ROUND-TRIP.

TC == $0.1384 [COST PER MILE TON]

'''

# - - - - - - -


'''
BUT EITHER WAY, STILL A LOT, NOW MULTIPLY IT BY TONS.

$ 0.1384 * 6500 = $899.60 [USING BRAZIL FORMULA]
$ 0.7692 * 6500 = $4999.80 [USING THE DRY TON COST OF [SLC, UTAH]]
$ 0.1800 * 6500 = $1170.00 [USING THE ONE I CALCULATED W/ AVERAGES.]


CONTINUE TMRW, BUT SHIT THIS IS GOOD. I LIKE IT.

YORK, PENNSYLVANIA ONE OTHER EXAMPLE.

THIS IS SEWAGE SLUDGE, BTW.

THE 1968 DIAMOND T. TANK TRUCK HAS A MAXIMUM FREEWAY CAPACITY OF 12.5 TONS.

https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+tons+can+a+1968+diamond+t.+tank+carry&sca_esv=e366935364740875&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS967US967&ei=e_o7ZtTQJNrsiLMPzsiHqAY&ved=0ahUKEwiU-sGWi_-FAxVaNmIAHU7kAWUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=how+many+tons+can+a+1968+diamond+t.+tank+carry&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiLmhvdyBtYW55IHRvbnMgY2FuIGEgMTk2OCBkaWFtb25kIHQuIHRhbmsgY2FycnlI5DlQE1iMNnABeAGQAQCYAcMDoAGsGKoBCjIxLjYuMS4wLjG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAhigAv8UwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICBRAhGKABwgIEECEYFcICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgIIECEYoAEYwwTCAgoQIRigARjDBBgKmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcKMTguNC4xLjAuMaAHjGA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp

IT IS A 6 MILES ONE-WAY.

SO THE AVERAGE COST PER TON-MILE IS ABOUT $0.18 USD

BUT NOW, WE NEED A FORMULA.

TO FINISH THE JOB. I FOUND IT ALREADY.


TC == [PF x {(CAP)^-1}] * 2D

TC == [73 x (12.5)^-1] * 12

73 = $73 USD/ METRIC TON 
12.5 = METRIC TONS IT CAN CARRY
12 = 2*6 MILES ONE-WAY, 2X FOR ROUND-TRIP.

TC == $70.08 [COST PER MILE TON]

AND THE AMOUNT OF TONS TRANSPORTED PER YEAR...

IT'S 1360 DRY TONS.

SO $70.08 x 1360 = 95308

THAT'S $95308.80 A YEAR. HELL FUCKN NO.

AND WE DIDN'T EVEN MULTIPLY BY THE MILES YET.

PROFIT WAS ONLY ~$1380.00

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOW, LET'S DO THE AVERAGE COST WITH THE VALUE I USED.

TC == [PF x {(CAP)^-1}] * 2D

TC == [0.18 x (12.5)^-1] * 12

0.18 = $0.18 AVERAGE COST PER MILE.
12.5 = METRIC TONS IT CAN CARRY
12 = 2*5 MILES ONE-WAY, 2X FOR ROUND-TRIP.

TC == $0.1728 [COST PER MILE TON]

IT'S 1360 DRY TONS TRANSPORTED PER YEAR. [VACUUM FILTRATION]

SO $0.1728 x 1360 = $235.00

OK.

NOW, TO TRANSPORT IT 6 MILES.

$235.00 x 6 = $1410.00

PROFIT IS ~$1380.00

SO STILL NOT PROFITABLE.

FOR YORK, PENNSYLVANIA, WE MUST GO =< 5 MILES TO GAIN SOME PROFIT.
