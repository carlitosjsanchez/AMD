# AMD

the #1 issue of converting AMD into ferric iron oxide for cement/concrete applications is the transportation costs.

more specifically, the transportation costs from the AMD treatment plant to the kiln or cement plant where it will be utilized.

nobody knows exactly how much one ton of sludge will cost per ton-mile.

so here are my numbers and estimates.

this comes from EPA data & from a technique for calculations from brazil.

i'll share my results using my method and brazil method.

my method was taking all the data, setting the averages, and then dividing them each to get a cost-per-mile.
